abstract = {Accessibility is an important quality factor of mobile applications. Many studies have shown that, despite the availability of many resources to guide the development of accessible software, most apps and web applications contain many accessibility issues. Some researchers surveyed professionals and organizations to understand the lack of accessibility during software development, but few studies have investigated how developers and organizations respond to accessibility bug reports. Therefore, this paper analyzes accessibility bug reports posted in the Chromium repository to understand how developers and organizations handle them. More specifically, we want to determine the frequency of accessibility bug reports over time, the time-to-fix compared to traditional bug reports (e.g., functional bugs), and the types of accessibility barriers reported. Results show that the frequency of accessibility reports has increased over the years, and accessibility bugs take longer to be fixed, as they tend to be given low priority.},
