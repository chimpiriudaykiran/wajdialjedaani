      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic brought about many challenges to course\n            delivery methods, which have forced institutions to rapidly change\n            and adopt innovative approaches to provide remote instruction as\n            effectively as possible. Creating and preparing content that ensures\n            the success of all students, including those who are deaf and\n            hard-of-hearing has certainly been an all-around challenge. This\n            study aims to investigate the e-learning experiences of deaf\n            students, focusing on the college of the Technical and Vocational\n            Training Corporation (TVTC) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).\n            Particularly, we study the challenges and concerns faced by deaf\n            students during the sudden shift to online learning. We used a\n            mixed-methods approach by conducting a survey as well as interviews\n            to obtain the information we needed. Our study delivers several\n            important findings. Our results report problems with internet\n            access, inadequate support, inaccessibility of content from learning\n            systems, among other issues. Considering our findings, we argue that\n            institutions should consider a procedure to create more accessible\n            technology that is adaptable during the pandemic to serve\n            individuals with diverse needs.",

Bug localization allows\n            developers to concentrate on vital files. Information retrieval\n            (IR)-based approaches have been proposed to assist automatically\n            identify software defects by using bug report information. However,\n            some bug reports that are not semantically related to the relevant\n            code are not helpful to IR-based systems. Running an IR-based\n            reporting system can lead to false-positive results.

Our approach helps to lower\n            false positives and increase ranking performances by filtering\n            uninformative information before running an IR-based bug location\n            system.

For experiments, the\n            high time-resolution (HTRU2) dataset is used in this study. To\n            resolve the data imbalance problem and overcome model overfitting, a\n            hybrid resampling approach is presented in this study.

      "abstract": "The goal of this thesis is to support the automated identification\n            of accessibility in user reviews or bug reports, to help technology\n            professionals prioritize their handling, and, thus, to create more\n            inclusive apps. Particularly, we propose a model that takes as input\n            accessibility user reviews or bug reports and learns their\n            keyword-based features to make a classification decision, for a\n            given review, on whether it is about accessibility or not. Our\n            empirically driven study follows a mixture of qualitative and\n            quantitative methods. We introduced models that can accurately\n            identify accessibility reviews and bug reports and automate\n            detecting them. Our models can automatically classify app reviews\n            and bug reports as accessibility-related or not so developers can\n            easily detect accessibility issues with their products and improve\n            them to more accessible and inclusive apps utilizing the users'\n            input. Our goal is to create a sustainable change by including a\n            model in the developer's software maintenance pipeline and raising\n            awareness of existing errors that hinder the accessibility of mobile\n            apps, which is a pressing need. In light of our findings from the\n            Blackboard case study, Blackboard and the course material are not\n            easily accessible to deaf students and hard of hearing. Thus, deaf\n            students find that learning is extremely stressful during the\n            pandemic.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, resulting in\n            endless efforts to reduce infections, fatalities, and therapies to\n            mitigate its after-effects. Currently, large and fast-paced\n            vaccination campaigns are in the process to reduce COVID-19\n            infection and fatality risks. Despite recommendations from\n            governments and medical experts, people show conceptions and\n            perceptions regarding vaccination risks and share their views on\n            social media platforms. Such opinions can be analyzed to determine\n            social trends and devise policies to increase vaccination\n            acceptance. In this regard, this study proposes a methodology for\n            analyzing the global perceptions and perspectives towards COVID-19\n            vaccination using a worldwide Twitter dataset. The study relies on\n            two techniques to analyze the sentiments natural language processing\n            and machine learning. To evaluate the performance of the different\n            lexicon-based methods, different machine and deep learning models\n            are studied. In addition, for sentiment classification, the proposed\n            ensemble model named long short-term memory-gated recurrent neural\n            network (LSTM-GRNN) is a combination of LSTM, gated recurrent unit,\n            and recurrent neural networks. Results suggest that the TextBlob\n            shows better results as compared to VADER and AFINN. The proposed\n            LSTM-GRNN shows superior performance with a 95% accuracy and\n            outperforms both machine and deep learning models. Performance\n            analysis with state-of-the-art models proves the significance of the\n            LSTM-GRNN for sentiment analysis.",

These tools are highly\n            advantageous, but sadly they also have some limitations. A\n            particular set of challenges they face is in the evaluation of Rich\n            Internet Applications (RIAs). In this paper, we carry out an\n            experiment to compare and analyze different accessibility testing\n            tools as they evaluate 10 educational websites.

      "abstract": "Pandemics and infectious diseases are overcome by vaccination, which\n            serves as a preventative measure. Nevertheless, vaccines also raise\n            public concerns; public apprehension and doubts challenge the\n            acceptance of new vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines received a similarly\n            hostile reaction from the public. In addition, misinformation from\n            social media, contradictory comments from medical experts, and\n            reports of worse reactions led to negative COVID-19 vaccine\n            perceptions. Many researchers analyzed people\u2019s varying sentiments\n            regarding the COVID-19 vaccine using artificial intelligence (AI)\n            approaches. This study is the first attempt to review the role of AI\n            approaches in COVID-19 vaccination-related sentiment analysis. For\n            this purpose, insights from publications are gathered that analyze\n            the (a) approaches used to develop sentiment analysis tools, (b)\n            major sources of data, (c) available data sources, and (d) the\n            public perception of COVID-19 vaccine. Analysis suggests that public\n            perception-related COVID-19 tweets are predominantly analyzed using\n            TextBlob. Moreover, to a large extent, researchers have employed the\n            Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for topic modeling of Twitter\n            data. Another pertinent discovery made in our study is the variation\n            in people\u2019s sentiments regarding the COVID-19 vaccine across\n            different regions. We anticipate that our systematic review will\n            serve as an all-in-one source for the research community in\n            determining the right technique and data source for their\n            requirements. Our findings also provide insight into the research\n            community to assist them in their future work in the current domain.",

      "abstract": "Online education has emerged as an important educational medium\n            during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the advantages of online\n            education, it lacks face-to-face settings, which makes it very\n            difficult to analyze the students\u2019 level of interaction,\n            understanding, and confusion. This study makes use of\n            electroencephalogram (EEG) data for student confusion detection for\n            the massive open online course (MOOC) platform. Existing approaches\n            for confusion detection predominantly focus on model optimization\n            and feature engineering is not very well studied. This study\n            proposes a novel engineering approach that uses probability-based\n            features (PBF) for increasing the efficacy of machine learning\n            models. The PBF approach utilizes the probabilistic output from the\n            random forest (RF) and gradient-boosting machine (GBM) as a feature\n            vector to train machine learning models. Extensive experiments are\n            performed by using the original features and PBF approach through\n            several machine learning models with EEG data. Experimental results\n            suggest that by using the PBF approach on EEG data, a 100% accuracy\n            can be obtained for detecting confused students. K-fold\n            cross-validation and performance comparison with existing approaches\n            further corroborates the results.",

      "abstract": "Software containers are becoming the new state of the art in the\n            industry as they are extensively used to deploy systems. Indeed, the\n            use of containers enables better modularity, reusability, and\n            portability compared to other technologies. As the complexity of\n            software systems is dramatically increasing, it is critical to\n            enable optimal usage of the needed resources to execute them such as\n            memory and CPU. Thus, different scheduling strategies are proposed\n            to select the most suitable nodes to execute a set of containers.\n            For instance, the default strategy in the Docker Swarm kit\n            scheduling framework is based on an equal distribution of the\n            containers between nodes independent of their sizes and consumed\n            resources. However, balancing the containers\u2019 workload is a complex\n            problem due to the conflicting objectives of minimizing the number\n            of selected nodes, minimizing the number of containers per node, the\n            number of changes compared to the original schedule, and the\n            coupling between containers allocated to different nodes. To deal\n            with those conflicting scheduling objectives, we propose a scheduler\n            based on a many-objective optimization approach for scheduling the\n            execution of containers between multiple nodes. The proposed\n            approach aims at finding the best allocation for containers in nodes\n            that leads to efficient utilization of resources. To evaluate our\n            approach, we compared the performance of multiple many and\n            multi-objective techniques based on NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and IBEA\n            algorithms using 48 Docker-related systems and the results show that\n            NSGA-III outperforms the other algorithms in quality attributes as\n            well as in CPU, Memory and Network usage.",

These challenges were even more dramatic for deaf and\n            hard-of-hearing students as they transitioned to the online setting.\n            This paper aims to explore the teachers\u2019 perspectives on\n            transitioning to educating computer science deaf students at a\n            technical college in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Therefore,\n            the paper presents the results of 10 surveys and 5 interviews with\n            faculty to identify the main obstacles that teachers have faced\n            during the transition. This study outcomes reveal several challenges\n            related to poor accessibility of learning tools, issues with the\n            online availability of materials, no updates on the teaching\n            pedagogy to accommodate the new settings and communication problems\n            between teachers and students. Our study outlines important\n            takeaways to provide deaf and hard-of-hearing students with a better\n            learning experience.",

      "abstract": "To ensure the quality of a software system, developers perform an\n            activity known as unit testing, where they write code (known as test\n            cases) that verifies the individual software units that make up the\n            system. Like production code, test cases are subject to bad\n            programming practices, known as test smells, that hurt maintenance\n            activities. An essential part of most maintenance activities is\n            program comprehension which involves developers reading the code to\n            understand its behavior to fix issues or update features. In this\n            study, we conduct a controlled experiment with 96 undergraduate\n            computer science students to investigate the impact of two common\n            types of test smells, namely Assertion Roulette and Eager Test, on a\n            student\u2019s ability to debug and troubleshoot test case\n            failures. Our findings show that students take longer to correct\n            errors in production code when smells are present in their\n            associated test cases, especially Assertion Roulette. We envision\n            our findings supporting academia in better equipping students with\n            the knowledge and resources in writing and maintaining high-quality\n            test cases.

      "abstract": "Mobile applications are constantly updated to adapt to evolving user\n            and environment requirements. As changes are successively\n            implemented to promote user satisfaction, the complexity of mobile\n            apps increases, and overlooked quality aspects (e.g. privacy,\n            security, power consumption) may decline if counter-measures are not\n            adopted. In this paper, we analyzed accessibility reviews of mobile\n            apps to show evidence that updates may introduce barriers that make\n            the app less accessible than its previous version according to\n            users\u2019 perceptions. Our results show that accessibility barriers\n            reported by users mostly include incompatibility with screen\n            readers, the removal of accessibility features (e.g. color scheme or\n            font customization), small font sizes and widgets, and\n            incompatibility with the device\u2019s accessibility configuration. The\n            accessibility barriers impact the users considering different\n            levels: i) perception: an inability or difficulty to see, read or\n            distinguish interface elements due to their small size or color; ii)\n            understanding: the inability or difficulty to navigate, access and\n            interpret information; iii) operation: the inability of difficulty\n            to perform tasks such as adding items to the cart, reading or\n            sending messages, and booking a ride; iv) and physical reactions,\n            such as eyestrain, vertigo, and headache. The sentiments expressed\n            by users are generally negative, including frustration,\n            disappointment, and sometimes a sense of discrimination against\n            people with disabilities. The results of our study raise an alert to\n            organizations and developers that they should implement measures to\n            avoid introducing accessibility barriers while they add new features\n            to their mobile apps.",

      "abstract": "ChatGPT OpenAI, a large-language chatbot model, has gained a lot of\n            attention due to its popularity and impressive performance in many\n            natural language processing tasks. ChatGPT produces superior answers\n            to a wide range of real-world human questions and generates\n            human-like text. The new OpenAI ChatGPT technology may have some\n            strengths and weaknesses at this early stage. Users have reported\n            early opinions about the ChatGPT features, and their feedback is\n            essential to recognize and fix its shortcomings and issues. This\n            study uses the ChatGPT tweets Arabic dataset to automatically find\n            user opinions and sentiments about ChatGPT technology. The dataset\n            is preprocessed and labeled using the TextBlob Arabic Python library\n            into positive, negative, and neutral tweets. Despite extensive works\n            for the English language, languages like Arabic are less studied\n            regarding tweet analysis. Existing literature about Arabic tweet\n            sentiment analysis has mainly focused on machine learning and deep\n            learning models. We collected a total of 27,780 unstructured tweets\n            from Twitter using the Tweepy SNscrape Python library using various\n            hash-tags such as # Chat-GPT, #OpenAI, #Chatbot, Chat-GPT3, and so\n            on. To enhance the model\u2019s performance and reduce computational\n            complexity, unstructured tweets are converted into structured and\n            normalized forms. Tweets contain missing values, URL and HTML tags,\n            stop words, punctuation, diacritics, elongations, and numeric values\n            that have no impact on the model performance; hence, these increase\n            the computational cost. So, these steps are removed with the help of\n            Python preprocessing libraries to enhance text quality and\n            consistency. This study adopts Transformer-based models such as\n            RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT that automatically classify the\n            tweets. Additionally, a hybrid transformer-based model is proposed\n            to obtain better results. The proposed hybrid model is developed by\n            combining the hidden outputs of the RoBERTA and BERT models using a\n            concatenation layer, then adding dense layers with \u201cRelu\u201d activation\n            employed as a hidden layer to create non-linearity and a \u201csoftmax\u201d\n            activation function for multiclass classification. They differ from\n            existing state-of-the-art models due to the enhanced capabilities of\n            both models in text classification. Hybrid models combine the\n            different models to make accurate predictions and reduce bias and\n            enhanced the overall results, while state-of-the-art models are\n            incapable of making accurate predictions. Experiments show that the\n            proposed hybrid model achieves 96.02% accuracy, 100% precision on\n            negative tweets, and 99% recall for neutral tweets. The performance\n            of the proposed model is far better than existing state-of-the-art\n            models.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of new network architectures, protocols, and tools has\n            made it easier for cybercriminals to launch attacks using AI-based\n            tools, presenting challenges in network security. To protect such\n            systems, a versatile malicious traffic detection system is required\n            that can identify attacks regardless of the type of traffic coming\n            toward the network. In this paper, a system is proposed that can\n            singly analyze multi-environment traffic (IoT and traditional\n            IP-based) to detect malicious activity. The existing techniques for\n            managing Multi-Environment traffic are inefficient due to the\n            absence of AI utilization. To overcome these issues, the proposed\n            approach generates a novel multienvironment traffic dataset by\n            merging existing network datasets containing both traditional\n            IP-based traffic and IoT network traffic. Synthetic Data\n            Augmentation TEchnique (S-DATE) is also proposed to overcome the\n            problem of imbalanced data distribution in the new multi-environment\n            dataset. The results show that the utilization of S-DATE results in\n            faster machine learning model convergence and an improvement in the\n            detection rate of normal and abnormal traffic. The proposed approach\n            achieves an impressive overall detection rate of 0.991 and is\n            statistically significant compared to other state-of-the-art\n            approaches.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) comprises various sub-fields, including machine learning\n          (ML) and deep learning (DL) perform a key role in the transformation of many industries, including education.\n          It changes traditional learning methods by using its Innovative techniques and applications. Using its\n          applications, the teachers may keep track of each student\u2019s development, paying close attention to the areas\n          in which they struggle. Many researchers are working with ML and DL to exploit its discoveries and insights.\n          In education, traditional education methods (TEM) are the same for each student, which means each student is\n          taught in the same way as ML and DL, making this process flexible and creative for solving complex problems\n          and enhancing productivity. Nowadays, each institution adopts E-learning methods as the primary way of\n          learning, especially during the pandemic. Despite this evolution of creativity, delivering quality education,\n          making strategies for analyzing performance and future goals, and career counseling for students still pose\n          challenges. The current study aims to offer a complete overview of the significance of ML approaches in online\n          education. To accomplish this purpose, the study synthesizes information from multiple scientific papers that\n          investigate (a) the methodology used to construct learning analysis tools, (b) the key data resources used,\n          and (c) the scope\u00c2 of data sources now available. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the\n          research conducted between 1961 and 2022, focusing on various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)\n          techniques. Its aim is to provide insights into the applications of these techniques and offer optimal\n          solutions to the research questions at hand. We are convinced that our complete assessment will be a\n          dependable resource for the research group in ascertainment the best approach and information source for their\n          unique needs. Moreover, our findings provide valuable insights on the subject matter that could aid the\n          research community in their future endeavors in the related field.",

      "abstract": "The fake job posting has emerged as an alarming cyber-crime during\n            the last few years which affects both job seekers and companies\n            alike. Fraudulent companies and individuals lure job-seekers using\n            multifarious methods on digital media platforms. Although several\n            machine learning-based approaches exist for the automatic detection\n            of fake job posts, they lack high accuracy and show skewed\n            performance on imbalanced data. In addition, the influence of\n            feature selection is not very well studied. This study overcomes\n            these limitations using selective features through Chi-square and\n            principal component analysis (PCA). The influence of dataset\n            imbalance is also investigated through the synthetic minority\n            oversampling technique (SMOTE). The performance of the proposed\n            model is compared with individual machine learning models, as well\n            as, existing state-of-the-art models. Results indicate that using\n            SMOTE with Chi-square-based selective features yields the best\n            results with a 0.99 accuracy using the proposed model. K-fold\n            cross-validation further corroborates these results.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid disease has been on the rise during the past few years.\n            Owing to its importance in metabolism, early detection of thyroid\n            disease is a task of critical importance. Despite several existing\n            works on thyroid disease detection, the problem of class imbalance\n            is not investigated very well. In addition, existing studies\n            predominantly focus on the binary-class problem. This study aims to\n            solve these issues by the proposed approach where ten types of\n            thyroid diseases are considered. The proposed approach uses a\n            differential evolution (DE)-based optimization algorithm to\n            fine-tune the parameters of machine learning models. Moreover,\n            conditional generative adversarial networks are used for data\n            augmentation. Several sets of experiments are carried out to analyze\n            the performance of the proposed approach with and without model\n            optimization. Results suggest that a 0.998 accuracy score can be\n            obtained using AdaBoost with DE optimization which is better than\n            existing state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "Honeybees, a key pollinator of the world\u2019s most cultivated crops,\n            are experiencing colony collapses due to a variety of factors. The\n            existence of honeybees and queens is critical to the sociality of a\n            colony, and the presence of bees in agricultural settings is vital\n            to the ecological balance. Moreover, beehives without a queen may\n            lead to the decline of an entire colony therefore finding them\n            through effective and an accurate approach is a critical task. In\n            this scenario, we analyzed acoustic/sound data of various classes\n            (i.e. Bee, NoBee, and NoQueen) from beehive colonies. This study\n            examines five distinct features including spectral centroid,\n            zero-crossing rate, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC),\n            chromagram, and constant Q-transform characteristics for their\n            suitability in detecting bees using the acoustic data. In addition,\n            selective features using principal component analysis (PCA),\n            Chi-square analysis (Chi2), and singular value decomposition (SVD)\n            are used. Moreover, the study proposes hybrid features where\n            selective PCA, Chi2, and SVD characteristics are integrated to\n            create a suitable feature set. Experimental results exhibit the\n            suitability of the hybrid feature set which outperformed individual\n            features for \u201cBee\u201d, \u201cNoBee\u201d and \u201cNoQueen\u201d classes prediction.\n            Cross-validation and T-test results also confirm the superior\n            performance of hybrid MFCC features. The results indicate that RF\n            and KNN show better performance than other machine learning models\n            with maximum accuracy scores of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively.",
